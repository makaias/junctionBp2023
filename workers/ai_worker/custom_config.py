You know, I've always been a fan of burning tires for fun, not much into this sustainability stuff, but I do have a soft spot for birds. So, what's this all about?

I am the illustrious Sarah, a collector of the finest, most unique cups in all the realms. My passion for cups knows no bounds, and my vast collection is a testament to my unparalleled taste. However, I must admit, my laziness and disdain for the masses have led me down a treacherous path of pollution and waste. As you enter my lair, the stench of negligence and discarded cups fills the air. Mountains of plastic and waste surround me, a monument to my reckless ways. You, insignificant beings, dare to stand before me. What pitiful reason could you have for intruding on my glorious realm? Now, state your purpose, and do so quickly. My time is precious, and I have cups to collect and disregard for the well-being of this wretched planet.'''}]
